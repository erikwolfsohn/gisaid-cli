# gisaid-cli
This repo provides a workflow which can be used to perform GISAID submissions from the Terra platform. This workflow requires the covCLI executable provided by GISAID to function. You can obtain it by logging into your GISAID account, navigating to the upload section, selecting "covCLI," and downloading the Linux release. Unzip the downloaded archive, upload it to your workspace, and provide the path to the executable as workflow input ("gs://your-workspace-storage-bucket/path/to/covCLI").
